Bugs, and Feature Ideas for Alien Invasion
--

Bugs:
- aliens start moving faster in the middle of the level (as they are deleted)
- it's not obvious that the level number is that

Feature ideas:
- have aliens shoot back at you
- create a leader board
- have a permanent high score
- have a cooler background (stars)
- make different alien types
    - have aliens worth different points
    - some aliens move at different speeds
- let the game start with a keyboard press
- pause button
- choose easy, medium, or high skill where the difficulty increases at different rates
- make power ups
    - super bullets
    - shoot more than one bullet at a time
